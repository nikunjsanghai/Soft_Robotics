Problem 1: The code needs the predefined functions of gradEb.m,gradEs.m,hesseEb.m and hessEs.m to run. The code gives out all the outputs asked for in Simulation 1.

Problem 3:The code gives out all the outputs asked for in Simulation 3. Helper functions are already included, to examine the difference between simulation and result from Euler Theory value of force applied in the code needs to be changed to 20,000 from the default value of 2000. No other changes are required.
